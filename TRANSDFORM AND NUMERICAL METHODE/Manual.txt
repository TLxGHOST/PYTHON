TO impelment any function of this package just use the function name and parameters required
first paprameter is f: f denotes the function on which the approximation is to be applied (will be the must and first parameter of all functions)

Othe Methods use diffrent parameters as mentioned in the list below:

-> Bisection methode : can be used as              ""   bi_mthd(f, a, b)    ""
  
  a: second parameter which will be the left end point of the interval
  b: third parameter which will be the right end point 

  tol: is the fourth parameter denoting tolerence for the root which is predefined but can be changed as per usage 
  max_iter: is the fifth and the last parameter which is already set to 100 iterations


-> Newton-Raphson methode :can be used as              ""   newton_raphson(f, df, x0)    ""
  
  df: second parameter which will be the derivative of the function
  x0: third parameter which is the intial guess 

  tol: is the fourth parameter denoting tolerence for the root which is predefined but can be changed as per usage 
  max_iter: is the fifth and the last parameter which is already set to 100 iterations

-> Regular Falsi methode :can be used as              ""  regula_falsi(f, a, b)    ""
  
  a: second parameter which will be the left end point of the interval
  b: third parameter which will be the right end point 

  tol: is the fourth parameter denoting tolerence for the root which is predefined but can be changed as per usage 
  max_iter: is the fifth and the last parameter which is already set to 100 iterations


  -> Secant methode:can be used as              ""   scnt_mthd(f, x0, x1)    ""
  
  x0: second parameter which will be the first intial guess
  x1: third parameter which will be the second intial guess

  tol: is the fourth parameter denoting tolerence for the root which is predefined but can be changed as per usage 
  max_iter: is the fifth and the last parameter which is already set to 100 iterations
